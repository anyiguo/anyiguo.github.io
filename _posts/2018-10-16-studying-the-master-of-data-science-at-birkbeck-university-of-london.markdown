### Overview for part-time students. 
There are six modules in year 1 and they are all compulsory. You'll share some of them with the Computer Science students as Birkbeck's Data Science programme has a heavy tilt towards computer science subjects (e.g. you will learn about computer systems and data structures which is uncommon for data science programmes)


### Course Agenda

1. Year 1 Term 1 (October - December)
	* [Principles of Programming](https://github.com/yanniey/Birkbeck-Principles-of-Programming-I)
	* [Big Data Analytics with R](https://github.com/yanniey/Birkbeck-Big-Data-Analytics-using-R)
	* [Fundamentals of Computing - Term 1](https://github.com/yanniey/Birkbeck-Fundamentals-of-Computing)

2. Year 1 Term 2 (January - April)
	* [Programming with Data](https://github.com/yanniey/Birkbeck-Programming-with-Data)
	* [Computer Systems](https://github.com/yanniey/Birkbeck-Computer-Systems)
	* Fundamentals of Computing - Term 2

3. Year 1 Term 3 (May - June)
	* There are no new courses in Term 3, but you will have at least one revision tutorial for each of the courses, as well as practice tutorials by some of the modules which are highly recommended to attend (e.g. Fundamentals of Computing Term 2)
	* Exams are scheduled in June for all modules in year 1 over three/four weeks.

### Useful resources
1. [Crash Course Computer Science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5nskjZ_GoI&list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNlUrzyH5r6jN9ulIgZBpdo&index=2): a fantastic serie on history of programming, episode 1 - 10 are especially useful for the **Computer Systems** course as they talk about ALU, RAM and cache, CPU and assembly lanauages. The rest of the episodes are also useful for the **Fundamentals of Computing** courses.
